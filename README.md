# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Food Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because I have always been interested in learning a bit about coding and would love to gain a new skill
- I am interested in learning about anything and everything about coding. It is mostly all new to me but I am excited to take on the challenge
