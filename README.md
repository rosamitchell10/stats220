This is my repo for STATS 220. 

# **A little about me:**
<!--- here is my unordered list --->
- I am *ALMOST FINISHED* my degree in Food Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because I have always been interested in learning a bit about coding and would love to gain a new skill
- I am interested in learning about anything and everything about coding. It is mostly all new to me but I am excited to take on the challenge

## Incase you're interested, here is my top 3 favourite study spots... 
<!--- here is my ordered list --->
1. Floor 5 of the general library
2. Quiet floors in Kate Edgar
3. Sci building computer labs when there are no classes in there
